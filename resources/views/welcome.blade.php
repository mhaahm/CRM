        <p>We will be creating a simple and easily customizable PM system to tracks projects, including milestones, tasks, hours, costs, and more. Since every project is unique, this tutorial merely means to build an application foundation; you should be able to easily extend it based on your requirements.</p>
        <p><h3>In our project management application,</h3></p>
        <p><b>Employees will be able to:</b></p>

            <li>View their tasks</li>
            <li>Log in hours worked</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Managers will be able to:</b></p>

        <p><h3>The Building Blocks of a Project Management System</h3></p>
        <p>Here are the primary functions of a project management system:</p>

        <p><b>Project planning:</b> To define a project schedule, a project manager may use the
            software to map project tasks and visually describe task interactions. </p>
        <p><b>Task management:</b> Allows the project manager to create and assign tasks, establish
            deadlines, and produce status reports.</p>
        <p><b>Resource management:</b>Defines responsibilities â€“ who is supposed to do what.</p>
        <p><b>Budgeting and cost tracking:</b> A good project management application facilitates budget reporting as
            well as viewing, notifying, and updating costs for stakeholders.</p>
        <p><b>Time tracking:</b>The software must have the ability to track time spent on all tasks and maintain
            records for third-party consultants.</p>
